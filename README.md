# War Game

A simple web-based implementation of the classic two-player card game "War".

## Overview

This project recreates the card game War, where two players compete to win all the cards in a standard 52-card deck. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a graphical interface for gameplay.

## How to Play

1. Each player is dealt half of the deck (26 cards each).
2. In each round, both players draw the top card from their deck.
3. The player with the higher card wins both cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck.
4. If the cards are of equal value, a "war" occurs:
    - Each player places three cards face down and one card face up.
    - The player with the higher face-up card wins all the cards in play.
    - If the face-up cards are equal again, the war repeats.
5. The game continues until one player has all the cards.
