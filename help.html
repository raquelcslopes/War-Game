<p class="title">WAR GAME EXPLANATION</p>

    <p>
      War is a simple yet exciting two-player card
      game where each player is dealt half of a standard 52-card deck. In each
      round, both players draw the top card from their deck and compare values.
      The player with the higher card wins both cards and adds them to the
      bottom of their deck. If the cards are of equal value, a "war" occurs:
      each player places three more cards face down and one face up. The highest
      face-up card wins all the cards in play. This continues until one player
      has all the cards, winning the game. War is based purely on luck, making
      it a fun and unpredictable battle!
